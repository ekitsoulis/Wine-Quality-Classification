# Wine-Quality-Classification
This project predicts wine quality using machine learning based on physicochemical properties. Models like Random Forest, SVM, KNN, and Decision Tree are tested, with Random Forest achieving 74.45% accuracy. The dataset is preprocessed, balanced using SMOTE, and evaluated using classification metrics and feature importance analysis.
